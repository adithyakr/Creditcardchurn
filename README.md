3. Introduction

Background
Credit Card processing companies play a significant role in the finance and payment ecosystem. According to a report from Business Insider, the credit card is expected to remain
the largest model of payment for an in-store purchase with an expected market cap of 1.82 trillion USD. Banks such as Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and/or financial
institutions like Discover collaborate with payment processing networks like Visa, MasterCard to issue credit cards to their customers.


To obtain a personal credit card in the United States or most countries, the applicant must be 18 years or older. With the widespread use of mobile and internet banking, access to credit cards
has rapidly grown. According to the ascent survey, there is a positive correlation between owning a credit card and education level. 47.3% of students get access to their first credit during
or before the end of their undergraduate. Though anyone over the age of 18 can apply for a credit card, the approval and credit limit depends on various factors such as income, payment
history, etc.

Problem Statement
The large market of credit cards is predominantly dominated by millennials and Generation- Z. This poses the risk of increased credit card attrition that a lot of banks and financial institutions
face today. In spite of an increase in the number of new credit cards issued, the high attrition rate ( around 15% in the United States) limits the revenue. Hence the case we propose is to
analyze the credit card data to derive insights, influencing factors, and probability of a customer churn.

Goals of Our Analysis
a. Look for influential factors that lead to customer churn.
b. Show behavior of credit limit with different categories of variables.
c. Predict the relationship of the customer with the bank based on gender, income in a
year.
d. Look for factors that influence transaction patterns.
